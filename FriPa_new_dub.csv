You had Foreign Minister Wendy Morton in Greece in April taking a lovely tour in Athens to talk about climate change. You had Greg Hands in March in Croatia, he did a tour in Slovenia I think as well. He flew back to the England where two people were just about to be allowed to sit on a park bench together. Ministers and special advisers haven't had to quarantine in this process and haven't had to do testing if they don't want to. This feeds into the idea of one rule for some and a different rule for others. But, I almost have to take issue with the premise of the question because as somebody who has had their first jab and very excited to get their second I think we still have a few issues here. We are always going to be living with the hypothetical of a new variant, and again we should be on top of this, and we should be concerned if there really is evidence it can undermine the vaccines.
If we are going to start talking about a two-tiered society where people who have been vaccinated have certain liberties returned, and people who haven't don't, that can't just happen through an update, through the travel secretary, through the Transport Secretary, it can't happen through an update at a press conference. It's got to happen in Parliament. There has to be a proper debate and scrutiny over the idea of a two-tier system. I would also just flag that if you do bring it in, especially in the near future, the people who are going to be left out of that are younger people who have stayed home for months over the past 18 months.","Look, I think it's a bit rich for this Government to be talking about continuing to curb our ability to travel in and out of the countries so greatly when its own ministers were traveling during the first lockdown.

Firstly, I think we have a record of failure with COVID protections at the border. Slow in the first place to formal quarantining, slow to mandatory testing, slow to hotel quarantining, and slow to put India on the red list. Now we have a situation where we have the traffic lights, the green, the amber, the red. We've seen chaos in our airports where passengers coming from any of the three categories and mixing together, sometimes it seems hours on end. Secondly, we have this mixed messaging on the amber list.
We have one government minister saying you can go and visit friends and family. Another one saying that it's only essential travel. Another said that we should regard holidays as essential travel. So that has been a complete and utter mess. Now, the government should think again, what should they actually do? What I say the government should do is abandon the amber list. The amber list becomes part of the red list, if you like. You have that hotel quarantining across the board on the amber countries and the existing red countries, then you can move to that limited green list. There's only 12 countries on it at the moment, a number of which are not accepting tourists in any event.

You saw Hong Kong stopping flights. Countries can't completely seal themselves off, but they delayed the entry. The problem we now have is twofold. First, we're pretty sure it's pretty transmissible, at least as much as B117, if not more, and that means the race just became even faster to get those younger people, the 30s and 40 year olds, the 20 year olds, people like me as well who are just unvaccinated and completely susceptible. So things might open, my risk does not necessarily change because I have no additional protection. The second thing is does it evade our vaccines? And yes, the vaccines look remarkable, they are holding up. Get vaccinated, you're in a much better position. But there's some uncertainty, and we always know with uncertainty we have to be cautious because we just don't know, and once we know, we can act. But I think right now our Achilles heel in Britain has been the borders and making sure that we don't have these repeated lockdown cycles. Because I think right now domestic recovery should be the focus. Domestic tourism, getting local businesses going. Ask people to fill up our hotels here, fill up tours here, go to your local shops.

I think with regard to the exact question, I think catch-up is a bit of a distraction, particularly for schools, particularly colleges and universities. Learning never stops, work never stops, we don't close in the summer. There's all sorts of preparation. The idea that people stop working and can invest time in catch-up is, in itself, problematic. To address the question, if there's going to be funding made available, and this will cost money, disadvantaged children taking part in play, in sports, funding for meal clubs, all of the things that families, teachers, children have been asking for I think is what will be crucial in the summer, not some idea of catch-up to pass SATs or pass exams and chanelling money where it is needed and engaging professionals in those conversations, not dictating to them yet more demands on their time."," I'm going to endorse the point that listening to professionals is vital to anything that happens going forward.
